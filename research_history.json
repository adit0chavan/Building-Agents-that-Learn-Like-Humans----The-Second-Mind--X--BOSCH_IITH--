    "summary": "The understanding of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for image tasks has evolved significantly across iterations. Initially, the focus was on exploring LLMs' ability to understand and interpret visual data, including images. As research progressed, the emphasis shifted to fine-tuning LLMs for specific image classification tasks, object detection, and image generation. The findings consistently highlighted the potential of LLMs in image analysis, with notable improvements in accuracy and effic"
